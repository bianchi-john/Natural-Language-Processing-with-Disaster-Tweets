# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets
The competition "Getting Started" is proposed as a task suitable for "novices" in the field of natural language processing. This is due, on the one hand, to the small size of the datasets provided and, on the other hand, to the binary classification task which is certainly more accessible if compared to multi-level classification.   The goal of this competition is, starting from a training dataset and an evaluation dataset, to realize a model, based on machine learning, able to distinguish between tweets that refer to a real disaster situation (natural disaster or other kind of anomaly/emergency) and those that are not.  This project illustrates the realization of two different models both able to perform this classification task: the first one, based on a traditional approach, uses the technique of feature engineering while the second one uses the Bert language model through Simple Transformers library.
